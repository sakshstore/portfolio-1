# My Portfolio
This is the source code from my porfolio site which can be found at [zaracooper.github.io](https://zaracooper.github.io). I wrote a tutorial on how I created and deployed it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. You can read it [here](https://zaracooper.github.io/blog/posts/hugo-github-portfolio/).
